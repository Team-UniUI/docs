# Wording is important!

- Tile: UI element, like a button or slot.
- Toolbox (editor): The collection of tiles on the left side.
- Greedy export: If the entire texture should be exported, instead of just the
  tiles that overlay Minecraft's texture.
- Components: The layers of your interface. Should've been called layers, but
  the original idea was that you could toggle buttons (so components!?) using
  these layers, so I called the layers components.
- Interface: Your UI.
