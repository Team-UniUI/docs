**UniUI** is an opinionated UI library for KubeJS.

# Let's get building.

To get started with UniUI, you need KubeJS. KubeJS is a Minecraft mod
that allows you to write scripts using JavaScript. It is required
to use KubeJS, so [download it](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs).
You're also gonna need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) for the CLI.

1. Run `npx uniui-kjs@latest` inside your minecraft instance directory.
2. Select `Install` to confirm installing UniUI.
3. Done!
