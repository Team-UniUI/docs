# Switching over to a production build

Thanks for trying out the early-access `v0.0.1-testing` build! Your feedback was really valuable.
You probably got linked here because you tried to update your UniUI, but it errored.

This is *intended behavior*. While it may seem contrary, this is the result of a CLI rewrite - so
that this won't ever be a problem again. There's a simple fix though!

Run the old CLI to upgrade to `v0.0.1-testing` - as simple as running `npx uniui-kjs@0.0.2 install`,
then selecting `v0.0.1-testing`. **MAKE SURE YOU PICK THE TESTING RELEASE!! THIS IS IMPORTANT!**
Selecting the one you actually want to upgrade to here won't work.
