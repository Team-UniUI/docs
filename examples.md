# Basic Examples

Here you can find some basic examples. This list isn't really complete, and if you
want to be featured here, post your interfaces **with share link (code optional)** in our
Discord's showcase channel. Depending on complexity, usefulness as an example and
code quality you may be featured here!

## Editor UI tutorial

The UI that you build in the Editor UI tutorial
([Building an interface > Using the Editor](/uniui/docs/editor-ui)).

(- example fdb29bdb7b9a90c32fe8073cd3450349 -)

## Confirm slot

A simple yes/no prompt with an item in the center. Could be used for confirming a
shop purchase or something like that. Also got the option to disable the yes button.
